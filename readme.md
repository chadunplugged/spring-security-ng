This project is used as an example to a problem with a missing 'X-CSRF-TOKEN' in an HTTP header related to Spring Security and Angular.

The example uses [Spring Security CSRF Token Interceptor for Angular](https://github.com/aditzel/spring-security-csrf-token-interceptor).

The problem is that the HEAD contains no 'X-CSRF-TOKEN'.
